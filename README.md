# Plant Finder

This program is designed to help novice gardeners pick which plants they want to plant. It will be limited to several vegetables to keep the project manageable. 
But, in the future there is possibility to broaden the scope to include more crops and possibly other plants as well. 
Once they have found plants that work, they are able to check all of the growing conditions required for that plant so they know what it needs.
